        The phenomenon of sound is the phenomenon of vibration. Something
        vibrates, which causes the air molecules around it to move and bump into
        the air molecules around them, causing them to move, and so on until the
        energy emitted from the original vibration source has naturally
        disappated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a chain reaction known as a sound wave. The molecules the waves
        are passing through do not move along with the wave, the wave is just a
        pattern of motion of the molecules it passes through caused by molecules
        bumping into each other in a chain reaction pattern.

        Eventually, these sound waves bounce off the anatomy of the inner ear,
        which converts the vibrations it receives into electrical impulses which
        are transmitted to the brain, and interpreted by our consciousness as
        the glorious experience known as <i>sound</i>.
