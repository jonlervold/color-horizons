        The Linear Scale by Cents tool can be used to temper intervals, which
        means intentionally modifying the generating interval so that it is
        slightly impure in order to make other intervals in the scales that that
        generator creates more in tune. It can also be used for the purpose of
        generating temperaments, which are systems which equate different ratios
        to one another. A full discussion of temperaments is currently beyond
        the scope of my personal knowledge, but we will touch on the basics of
        the most important one.

      <h4 className="center">12 Tone Equal Temperament</h4>
      <p>
        The primary example of a temperament is 12 Tone Equal Temperament, the
        most commonly used musical system in the world. Whether they are aware
        of it or not, 12 Tone Equal Temperament is the way most people solve the
        problems with other pure-ratio-based tuning systems discussed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        12 Tone Equal Temperament equates 12 stacks of the 3/2 ratio (701.955
        cents) with 2/1 (1200 cents).
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, we examined what happens when 3/2 is stacked on top of
        itself 11 times to create a scale with 12 unique pitches (Pythagorean
        Tuning). Despite using a pure 3/2 as the generating interval, we still
        ended up with one wolf fifth at 678 cents. Here's why:
      </p>
      <p>
        When 3/2 is stacked on top of itself 12 times, the final value comes
        close to 2/1 (1200 cents), but ends up slightly above by ~23.460 cents.
        This value is known as the Pythagorean Comma. (The Pythagorean Comma can
        also be expressed (3/2)<sup>12</sup>
        /(2/1)<sup>7</sup> or 531441/524288.)

        To eliminate this difference, we can deliberately mistune the 3/2
        generating ratio. This process is known as "tempering out" the comma. In
        this case, we would take the Pythagorean Comma and divide it by 12,
        since we arrived at this comma by stacking twelve 3/2s on one another.
      </p>

      </table>
      <p>
        Then, we reduce our original generator of ~701.955 cents by ~1.955 and
        arrive at exactly 700 cents for the generator of 12 Tone Equal
        Temperament. Now, 12 stacks of the not-quite-justly-intonated 3/2 our
        system uses exactly equal 2/1.

        No matter how many iterations you run, stacking 3/2 will always repeat
        infinitely, never exactly looping back onto 2/1. By tempering out this
        comma, we create an even, closed system that loops back in on itself,
        allowing for free key modulation. With this type of system, we don't
        need to worry about different keys having different tonal
        characteristics.{" "}

        When compared directly against the simple JI ratios that each 12TET
        interval approximates, it is easy to hear that the intervals are
        somewhat out of tune. But our collective consciousness seems to have
        determined that the positives of this system are worth it. Within 12TET,
        we have relatively few notes that allow us to create fairly complex
        harmonies with good-enough pitch accuracy.

        12TET is an excellent system overall for many reasons. But there are
        multitudes of other options that allow for aural world building that
        12TET simply does not have available. This brings us to the point of
        this entire project: help facilitate exploration of the universe of
        harmony and encourage people to make music in alternative systems.

        As an additional, less familiar example, we will examine the phenomenon
        known as Mavila scales. Mavila is a temperament that equates 3 stacks of

        This difference is known as the Pelogic Comma and has a value of ~92.179
        cents. This comma can also be expressed (3/2)<sup>3</sup>
        /(8/5)
        <sup>1</sup> or 135/128.
      </p>
      <p>
        To modify our generating 3/2 so that three iterations creates a perfect
        8/5, we take the Pelogic Comma and divide it by 3, yielding ~30.726
        cents. Then we subtract that value from the pure 3/2 (701.955 cents) and
        arrive at 671.288 cents for our generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mavila Temperaments have an interesting characteristic: when extended to
        7 notes, it provides what is known as an anti-Diatonic scale. Instead of
        LLLsLLs step sizes, it creates sssLssL. By applying modal
        transformations, one can find anti-Lydian, anti-Aeolian, anti-Dorian,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that this is not the one and only Mavila Temperament,
        Mavila is a range of temperaments. This version with a generator of
        671.288 creates a pure 8/5 target ratio (known as this temperament's
        "eigenmonzo", or unchanged interval). But one can choose to deliberately
        mistune the target ratio as well as the generating ratio, in order to
        bring other intervals that the scale creates closer to purer harmonies.
        The limits of what constitutes a Mavila Temperament are generally
        considered to be generators between 666.667 cents and 685.713 cents.
